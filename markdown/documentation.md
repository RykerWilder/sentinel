### Documentation
Sentinel is a Swiss Army knife for cybersecurity, we try to keep it updated and add new features all the time.

After configuring venv and installing all dependencies, we can run the `sentinel-start` command. If everything has been done as explained above, a welcome message will appear with the sentinel logo and a link to this documentation.

Immediately after the welcome we can use the menu to use the different tools that are included within sentinel.

**Please note**, only tools are present in the menu, to see all the other commands on sentinel, scroll down to `commands`.
